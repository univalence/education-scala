 * ==STRING INTERPOLATION==
 *
 * String interpolation allows you to create string with placeholders.
 * To do so, you have to prefix the string with `s` and use `$` with a
 * variable name to represent a placeholder.
 *
 * Note#1: the placeholder might be an expression in this case, you have
 * to delimit the expression with curly braces `{}`. Eg. `s"one plus one
 * is ${1 + 1}"`.
 *
 * Note#2: there are other available prefixes, like `f` for simple
 * formatted string (eg. `f"height is $height%2.2f meters tall."`), or
 * `raw` for string with no escaping symbol (eg. `raw"success \o/"`
